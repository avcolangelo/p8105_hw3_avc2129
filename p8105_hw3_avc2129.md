## Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

``` r
data("instacart")
```

There are 1384617 total observations in this dataset of 131209 unique
users and 15 variables. Character variables include `eval_set`,
`product_name`, `aisle`, and `department`, and the rest of the variables
in the dataset are numeric. The average hour of the day that each
product was ordered was hour 13.5775922, while the median day of the
week of each product was ordered was day 3.

Example: Order id \#1 has a user id of 112108 and this was their fourth
order on Instacart. They ordered this at 10am and ordered eight products
such as Bulgarian Yogurt and organic celery hearts. We can also
determine the department and aisle from which each product came from. We
can also tell it’s been 9 days since their previous order.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(order_id == 1)
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 x 15
    ##   order_id product_id add_to_cart_ord~ reordered user_id eval_set
    ##      <int>      <int>            <int>     <int>   <int> <chr>   
    ## 1        1      49302                1         1  112108 train   
    ## 2        1      11109                2         1  112108 train   
    ## 3        1      10246                3         0  112108 train   
    ## 4        1      49683                4         0  112108 train   
    ## 5        1      43633                5         1  112108 train   
    ## 6        1      13176                6         0  112108 train   
    ## 7        1      47209                7         0  112108 train   
    ## 8        1      22035                8         1  112108 train   
    ## # ... with 9 more variables: order_number <int>, order_dow <int>,
    ## #   order_hour_of_day <int>, days_since_prior_order <int>,
    ## #   product_name <chr>, aisle_id <int>, department_id <int>, aisle <chr>,
    ## #   department <chr>

  - How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

There are 134 aisles. The aisles most items are ordered from are fresh
vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables fruits

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

  - Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, n), y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Items Ordered in Aisles",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 
```

  - Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  select(product_name, aisle) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n, aisle)) %>% 
  top_n(3, n) %>% 
  rename(
    Aisle = aisle, Product = product_name, Number = n) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Aisle                      | Product                                         | Number |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                            |   3324 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                             |   1920 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                             |   1692 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                               |    157 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                                |    140 |
| baking ingredients         | Organic Vanilla Extract                         |    122 |
| dog food care              | Organix Grain Free Chicken & Vegetable Dog Food |     14 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe             |     13 |
| dog food care              | Original Dry Dog                                |      9 |

  - Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(
      product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", 
                        "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  select(
    order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) %>%
  group_by(
    product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
     mutate(
      order_dow =
        recode(order_dow, 
            "0" = "Sunday" , "1" = "Monday",
            "2" = "Tuesday", "3" = "Wednesday",
            "4" = "Thursday", "5" = "Friday",
            "6" = "Saturday"),
    mean_hour = round(mean_hour, digits = 2)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour) %>%
  rename(
    Product = product_name) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Product          | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| :--------------- | -----: | -----: | ------: | --------: | -------: | -----: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream |  13.22 |  15.00 |   15.33 |     15.40 |    15.17 |  10.33 |    12.35 |
| Pink Lady Apples |  12.25 |  11.68 |   12.00 |     13.94 |    11.91 |  13.87 |    11.56 |

## Problem 2

This problem uses the BRFSS data. DO NOT include this dataset in your
local data directory; instead, load the data from the p8105.datasets
package.

``` r
data("brfss")
```

First, do some data cleaning: \* format the data to use appropriate
variable names; \* focus on the “Overall Health” topic \* include only
responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” \* organize responses as a factor
taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent

``` r
clean_brfss =
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(
     topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  rename(
    county = "locationdesc",
    state = "locationabbr",
    resp_id = "respid") %>%
  mutate(
    county = 
      gsub(".*-", "", county, perl = TRUE),
    response = 
      factor(response, 
             levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good",
                        "Very good", "Excellent"),
             ordered = TRUE)
  ) 
```

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

  - In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
    about in 2010?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
clean_brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    locations = n_distinct(county)
  ) %>%
  filter(locations >= 7) %>%
  arrange(desc(locations)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | locations |
| :---- | --------: |
| PA    |        10 |
| MA    |         8 |
| NJ    |         8 |
| CT    |         7 |
| FL    |         7 |
| NC    |         7 |

``` r
clean_brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    locations = n_distinct(county)
  ) %>%
  filter(locations >= 7) %>%
  arrange(desc(locations)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | locations |
| :---- | --------: |
| FL    |        41 |
| NJ    |        19 |
| TX    |        16 |
| CA    |        12 |
| MD    |        12 |
| NC    |        12 |
| NE    |        10 |
| WA    |        10 |
| MA    |         9 |
| NY    |         9 |
| OH    |         8 |
| CO    |         7 |
| PA    |         7 |
| SC    |         7 |

In 2002, 6 states were observed at 7 or more locations: Pennslyvania,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina. In
2010, 14 states were observed at 7 or more locations: Florida, New
Jersey, Texas, California, Maryland, North Carolina, Nebraska,
Washington, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Colorado, Pennslyvania, and
South Carolina. From 2002 to 2010, the number of states observed at 7 or
more locations more than doubled.

  - Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing
    a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and
    group aesthetic will help).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
clean_brfss %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  mutate(
    avg_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>%
  select(year, state, avg_data_value) %>%
  
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Data Value over Time",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Average Data Value"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_avc2129_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

From the spaghetti graph, we can see that average data value is pretty
volatile but within the range of 0-30.

  - Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY State

<!-- end list -->

``` r
clean_brfss %>%
  filter(
    state == "NY", 
    year == c("2006", "2010")) %>% 

 
  select(year, response, data_value) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
     facet_grid(~year) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of data-value for 
    Responses in NYS",
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data Value"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_avc2129_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />
We can see from the two box plots that they both follow patterns of
movement between response categories. It appears 2010 had higher data
values. In both years, “good” and “very good” responses seemed to elicit
the highest data values.

## Problem 3

  - Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset
    should include all originally observed variables and values; have
    useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and
    encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting
    dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(day_of_week = "day",
         week_number = week) %>%
   pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
   names_to = "activity_number",
    values_to = "activity_counts") %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_number = 
      gsub(".*_", "", activity_number, perl = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(
    weekend = (day_of_week == "Saturday" | day_of_week == "Sunday"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The dataset has 50400 observations and 6 variables. The variables
include `week`and `day_id` (both numeric variables), `day of week` and
`activity_number` (both character variables), `activity_counts`
(numeric), and whether or not it was a `weekend` (a boolean variable).

  - Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total
    activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross
    minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create
    a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

It’s difficult to tell from a table, a graph might be more appropriate
here. It doesn’t appear for activity to increase as the number of days
increases.

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  rename("Day" = day_id, "Total Activity" = total) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Day | Total Activity |
| --: | -------------: |
|   1 |      480542.62 |
|   2 |       78828.07 |

|   8 |      568839.00 |
|   9 |      295431.00 |
|  10 |      607175.00 |

|  15 |      467420.00 |
|  16 |      685910.00 |
|  17 |      382928.00 |
|  18 |      467052.00 |

|  29 |      620860.00 |
|  30 |      389080.00 |
|  31 |        1440.00 |
|  32 |      138421.00 |
|  33 |      549658.00 |

|  35 |      445366.00 |

  - Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
    the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity
    time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
    Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
    this graph
